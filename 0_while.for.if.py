#for
#The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal),
#or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence
#(a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

    print(word + " "  + str(len(word)) )
